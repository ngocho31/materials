\subsection{Discoverable hardware: USB and PCI}

\begin{frame}{Discoverable hardware}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some busses have built-in hardware discoverability mechanisms
  \item Most common busses: USB and PCI
  \item Hardware devices can be enumerated, and their characteristics
    retrieved with just a driver or the bus controller
  \item Useful Linux commands
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{lsusb}, lists all USB devices detected
    \item \code{lspci}, lists all PCI devices detected
    \item A detected device does not mean it has a kernel driver
      associated to it!
    \end{itemize}
  \item Association with kernel drivers done based on product
    ID/vendor ID, or some other characteristics of the device: device
    class, device sub-class, etc.
  \end{itemize}
